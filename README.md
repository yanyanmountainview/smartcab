# smartcab
Applied reinforcement learning techniques for a self-driving agent in a simplified world 
to aid it in effectively reaching its destinations in the allotted time. 

# install
This project is built in python, and upon the following Python libraries: Numpy, PyGame

# Usage example

Improve the learning algorithm in agnet.py

usig the code below to adjsut update_delay and whether to display in the simulator
  def run():
      """Run the agent for a finite number of trials."""# Development setup
